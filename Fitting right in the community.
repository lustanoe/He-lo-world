How is everyone out there. I am new here and I want all of you to put me strainght on point as to how things are done here to make things right for me and others. It is disappoing to do things that are oit of community charecter.
Nowadays you find that I for instance would want to push my agenda into the people by force. I find that offensive. This is why I need to know the philosophy pf this community.
